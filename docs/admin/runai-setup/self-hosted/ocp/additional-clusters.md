# Installing additional Clusters

The first Run:ai cluster is typically installed on the same OpenShift cluster as the Run:ai control plane. Run:ai supports multiple clusters per single control plane. This document is about installing additional clusters on __different OpenShift clusters__.

A solution for installing additional clusters is only available in Run:ai version __2.13__ and up.
